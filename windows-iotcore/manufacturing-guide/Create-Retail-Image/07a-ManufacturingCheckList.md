# Device Manufacturing Check List

One of the ultimate goals for creating an IoT image for a device is so that you can have a eventually have a mass produced IoT device. The follwing is a list of check boxes and guides that you may want to complete before you send the device for mass production. Although it is a guide, you do not have to follow every single step in the guide for a device to be "manufacturing" ready. The manufacturing readiness is ultimately set by you and your needs alone.

## Testing Retail Image
A user can easily verify a custom test image for Windows IoT Core just by turning on a device with the image flashed on the device. Once the device is running, you can run through various checks to verify that the device is truly functional. The ease of these tests depends on the levels of security factors baked into the image. Since there are no security protocols built-in on a test image, you can use all available development tools to test the IoT device. 

The task of testing becomes harder for a custom retail image for Windows IoT Core, as you can include security protocols as part of the image installed into the device. Due to the nature of these security protocols, you may not be able to use available test tools to verify the device, so you may want to write a test application that can run on the IoT device. This application would then perform the verification tests of the various areas and functions of the IoT device. 

Testing of a custom retail image for Windows IoT Core can be done by one of the following ways:

### Clean Retail Image Test
If you truly want to have a clean retail image, you will need to create two retail images for your device. These two images will be identical except that one image will include your testing application (configured as a foreground application), while the other "clean" image will not. You would flash the first image (with the test application included) and perform the testing validations on your IoT device. Once verified, you can then re-flash your IoT device with the second "clean" retail image, for distribution.

**Pros**: Final retail image will be totally clean and only the items that are deemed necessary are included in the image.

**Cons**: Including a test application to the retail image could introduce some potential issues with the provisioning package(s), as well as potential user errors in the test application. This would make this retail image different than the final retail image.

### One Time Passthrough Test
Only one final retail image is created, and would also include the test application. You would configure the image such that once the out-of-box-experience (OOBE) application is launched, your test application is launched (as a foreground application). A conditional statement within the test application would be triggered so that the application is aware that it ran once before (preventing it from running after the first time the device is powered on).

```CSharp
// Declare variable
Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = 
    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
    
// Set variable as boolean, numbers, or string values as needed at approperiate location within the test app
localSettings.Values["appRanOnce"] = false;    

// Read variable and verify value to check and apply logic
Object value = localSettings.Values["appRanOnce"];

```
> [!NOTE]
> For best results, only use `localSettings` to store the variables to store the settings values.
> There is a possible chance of undesirable results from using `roamingSettings` features.
> `localSettings` can only hold 64k of data at the time of this writing [[More on Application Settings]](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data)

Using the code block above, you can apply the logic on launch of your test application so that on subsequent launches, the application takes appropriate actions.

So what types of actions can I take?

- Launch another FGA app
- Edit the Registry to modify the boot sequence

#### Launching Another FGA Application from your Test Application

If you are launching a Microsoft store app, you can use the following code snippet to launch apps installed and updated through the store.
Additional information on URI schemes can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-store-app).

````CSharp
// Following will launch the Microsoft store app and navigate to the Games section
bool result = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(new Uri
    ("ms-windows-store://navigatetopage/?Id=Games"));

// Following will launch the One Note app using the package family name (PFN)
bool result = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(new Uri
    ("ms-windows-store://pdp/?PFN= Microsoft.Office.OneNote_8wekyb3d8bbwe"));
`````

If you are launching a custom (non-Microsoft store) app, you can use `AppServiceConnection` to launch an app using package family name (PFN). 


First, you must register the final app (com.concurrency.lwinsapp) with app services within the system. You will need to modify the `Package.appxmanifest` file to include the following code block in the `<Applications>` section of the manifest.
```Xaml
<Application Id="App" Executable="$targetnametoken$.exe" EntryPoint="AppServiceProvider.App">
      <Extensions>
        <uap:Extension Category="windows.appService" EntryPoint="MyAppService.AppLaunchService">
          <uap3:AppService Name="com.concurrency.lwinsapp" uap4:SupportsMultipleInstances="true" />
        </uap:Extension>
      </Extensions>
      ...
</Application>
```

Following code segment will launch a custom application:

````CSharp
private AppServiceConnection appLaunchService;
...
this.appLaunchService = new AppServiceConnection();
this.appLaunchService.AppServiceName = "com.concurrency.lwinsapp";
this.appLaunchService.PackageFamilyName = "f3a114f7-e099-4773-8c93-77abcba14f62_004hcn5rxyy0y";
var status = await this.appLaunchService.OpenAsync();
````

By combining logic between `localSettings` and `AppServiceConnection`, you can bypass your test application on every boot of the device. In essence, your test application will run on every boot but "passthrough" to the final application on boot. If needed, you can set your logic in such a way that device will not continue to the final application if tests fails on your test application. This might be helpful if you need to verify that the device is fully tested and functional on every boot.

**Pros**: You can test the device automatically on every boot to ensure that certain conditions are set correctly and the device is fully tested (and secure).

**Cons**: Your test application is included with the retail image. There is the potential of your application having security holes. Please make sure that your test app is locked down as needed. Due to the nature of your test application, you may be able to modify features of the device.
