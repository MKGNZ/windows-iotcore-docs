# Device Manufacturing Check List

One of the ultimate goals for creating an IoT image for a device is so that you can have a eventually have a mass produced IoT device. The follwing is a list of check boxes and guides that you may want to complete before you send the device for mass production. Although it is a guide, you do not have to follow every single step in the guide for a device to be "manufacturing" ready. The manufacturing readiness is ultimately set by you and your needs alone.
